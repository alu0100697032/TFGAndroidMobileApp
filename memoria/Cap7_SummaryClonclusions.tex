\chapter{Summary and Conlusions}
At the end of the work, I have learn some conceptsto develop Android and Django applications. The part which has more hours dedicated is the investigation of the technologies because the application has many details unknown by the author.

I have designed, developed and desployed an Android application that is able to authenticate users, access remote data and interact with a Django application which offer a reserve system to authenticated users.

Time management has been very important in this project, because it has combined with the subject ``Prácticas Externas'' also studied in the fourth year 
of the Degree in Computing Engineering. 
As a result, I have improved my skills in managing tasks related to software engineering.

I have also learned to draw up a Technical Report using \textit{LaTeX}, unknown so far.

The development of App could be continued by implementing some of the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Possibility of authentication against ULL servers. 
\item Improve the reserve system.
\item Add other services offer by the ULL, for example the Library.
\end{itemize}
